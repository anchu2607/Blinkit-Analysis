**Business Problems and Solutions**

**1. Uneven Sales Across Outlet Locations**

**Observation:**

Tier 3 outlets generate the highest total sales ($472.1K), while Tier 1 outlets contribute the least ($336.4K).
Business Problem:

Tier 1 outlets underperform due to potential issues like insufficient inventory, poor customer engagement, or low accessibility.

**Solution:**

Conduct a market analysis for Tier 1 locations to identify gaps.
Increase promotions or improve inventory and product mix for Tier 1 outlets.
Leverage region-specific campaigns to attract more customers.

**2. Disparity in Sales by Outlet Size**

**Observation:**

Large outlets contribute 37% of sales ($444.8K), while smaller outlets lag significantly ($249K, 21%).

**Business Problem:**

Smaller outlets may lack product variety or face challenges in attracting customers.

**Solution:**

Focus on high-demand items (e.g., Fruits & Vegetables) in small outlets.
Introduce home delivery services for smaller outlets.
Ensure inventory optimization to reduce stock-outs of popular products.

**3. Fat Content Preference Analysis**
   
**Observation:**

Regular fat products dominate sales (64.6%), while low-fat items account for 35.4%.

**Business Problem:**

The low-fat segment may represent an untapped opportunity to cater to health-conscious customers.

**Solution:**

Market low-fat items as healthier alternatives via promotions and awareness campaigns.
Offer discounts on low-fat products to encourage trial purchases.
Partner with influencers or health advocates to drive demand for low-fat products.

**4. Unequal Contribution by Product Categories**
   
**Observation:**

Fruits & Vegetables ($178.1K) and Snack Foods ($175.4K) dominate sales, while categories like Seafood ($9.1K) and Breakfast ($15.6K) lag.

**Business Problem:**

Underperforming categories indicate low customer interest or poor promotion.

**Solution:**

Use promotions like combo offers for breakfast items or seafood to drive sales.
Conduct surveys to understand why certain categories are less popular.
Optimize product placement in outlets to improve visibility of underperforming categories.

**5. Stagnant Growth in Outlet Establishments**
   
**Observation:**

Outlet establishment growth peaked in 2018 ($204.5K) but has since stagnated.

**Business Problem:**

Growth may have plateaued due to market saturation or inefficiencies.

**Solution:**

Expand into untapped regions with high growth potential (e.g., underserved Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities).
Embrace digital transformation with online ordering and delivery to reach new markets.
Focus on operational efficiency in existing outlets to maximize profits.

**6. Low Average Sales Per Transaction**

**Observation:**

The average sales value per transaction is $141, indicating room for improvement.

**Business Problem:**

Low transaction value reduces profitability and customer lifetime value.

**Solution:**

Introduce loyalty programs that incentivize higher spending per transaction.
Offer product bundles or curated combos to encourage bulk purchases.
Train sales staff to cross-sell and upsell effectively.

**7. Outlet Type Performance Gap**

**Observation:**
